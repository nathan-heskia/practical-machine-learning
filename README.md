# Practical Machine Learning in R

This repository contains assignments I completed for a machine learning course at UC Berkeley Extension in Winter/Spring 2020. Below is the list of datasets you'll need if you want to run a particular assignment:

| Assignment | Data Set Name | Link |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Decision Trees | Zoo | [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo) |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Lending Club Historical Loan Issuance - Q3 2019 | [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/statistics/additional-statistics) |
| Linear Regression | Lending Club Historical Loan Issuance - Q4 2019 | [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/statistics/additional-statistics) |
| Market Basket Analysis | Instacart Market Basket Analysis | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) |
| Neural Networks | Sign Language MNIST | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) |
| Random Forests | Phishing Website | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/akashkr/phishing-website-dataset) |

Some models in the Neural Networks assignment require several hours to train.
